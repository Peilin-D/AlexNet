  date: Sep 11, 2017
  skip_layer: fc7, fc8
  not using keypts
  fix pretrianed weights
  weight decay: 0.0005
  FIFO queue for inputs
  no moving average
  AdamOptimizer()
  evaluate every 800 steps
  results: 
   couldn't converge, loss is at 3~, best_ckpt is step 2633 


ckpt_3:
  shallow model (inference)
  3 conv layer pretrained, fixed, 2 fc layer trainable, fc4 output size 1024
