  almost same as ckpt_2, except for using SGD with learning rate 0.01, this seems crucial to lift the test acc to 0.5.

ckpt_3/4/5:
  shallow model (inference)
  3 conv layer pretrained, fixed, 2 fc layer trainable, fc4 output size 1024/4096/2048
  _3 seems underfit, train acc 0.6, test acc 0.3
  _4/5 train acc 0.99, test acc 0.4

  using keypts with images where only 1 person's pose is detected. 
  concat keypts positions after fc6 drop out
  achieve almost the same result as no keypts used.
